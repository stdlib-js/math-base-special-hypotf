    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
import hypotf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-hypotf@esm/index.mjs';
```
The previous example will load the latest bundled code from the esm branch. Alternatively, you may load a specific version by loading the file from one of the [tagged bundles](https://github.com/stdlib-js/math-base-special-hypotf/tags). For example,

```javascript
import hypotf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/math-base-special-hypotf@v0.2.4-esm/index.mjs';
```

#### hypotf( x, y )

Computes the [hypotenuse][hypotenuse] avoiding overflow and underflow (single-precision).

```javascript
var h = hypotf( -5.0, 12.0 );
// returns 13.0

h = hypotf( -0.0, -0.0 );
// returns +0.0
```

If either argument is `NaN` and the other argument is not `+-Infinity`, the function returns `NaN`.

```javascript
var h = hypotf( NaN, 12.0 );
// returns NaN

h = hypotf( 5.0, NaN );
// returns NaN
```
